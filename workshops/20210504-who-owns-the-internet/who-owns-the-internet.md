# Who owns the Internet?

???
This is part one of our series, what is the Internet.

Part one will focus on who owns all the things that we rely on

to go online.

--
## 1. What is the Internet?

???
First, we need to go over what the internet is and how it works.

This will be from a very high level- we are not getting overly technical.

--
## 2. Who owns the Internet?

???
Then we will discuss who owns what in the internet, with a particular focus
--
## 3. Who owns my data?

???
on our data and the ways in which online services try to collect and use it.

The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.

# What is the Internet?

## TL;DR: A system of networks made up of hardware and software that enable data to go from one point to another.

???
So, can we answer the question to who owns the internet now? 

Not yet. First we need to go over how these networks actually function.

# What happens when I click on the _Like_ button in Facebook?

<captioned-image img-file="img/like-button.png" img-width="20"></captioned-image>

???
In order to provide some context and help us visualize things more easily,

let's talk about a particular example.

Imagine you are in facebook and you click "like" on a post. What happens then?

We will follow the data as it travels from your computer to facebook.

Please note that for the sake of simplicity and brevity, we will 

present things in a very simple manner.

### Sends and receives data to and from the switch or access point

<img class="breadcrumbs-crowdcast" src="img/wires-crumbs-pc.svg">

???
This computer may be a desktop, laptop, or a smartphone.

It is responsible for sending and receiving data to and from a network.

Your personal computer is the point of entry to the Internet.

When you click the "Like" button under a post, the computer assembles a packet

of data and send it out through its network card.

This packet of data will contain the recipient (facebook) and the payload

(such as "user so-and-so has clicked this post").

---
## Access Point (AP)

### Allows WiFi devices to join a Local Area Network (LAN)

<img class="breadcrumbs-crowdcast" src="img/wires-crumbs-ap.svg">

???
A combination of a radio and antenna

If your home network contains WiFi, this is the device that makes it possible.

You can have multiple access points in a network.

This devices receives the data packet from your computer and sends it to the switch.

suitable for a transmission medium (like telephone lines)

---
class: router-modem

## Do I have a router? A modem?

![Gateway](img/gateway.jpg)
![Black AP](img/ap-router.jpg)

### Or a "gateway"?

???
The ISP may rent you what they call a modem or router

Each function could be performed by a separate device,

depending on how you want to set up your network

Your ISP may provide either a modem or a "gateway": This is a device that performs multiple roles: modem, router, switch, and wireless access point.

### Receives and processes data from users

<img class="breadcrumbs-crowdcast" src="img/wires-crumbs-server.svg">

???
After going through the ISP network, the packet finally arrives

at a computer inside one of Facebook's many data centres around the world.

That covers the wires.

# The "apps"

???
Let's take a look at the apps now.

## Communication protocols

### Establish how to package and route data

<div style="float: left; font-size: 1.6rem; font-style:italic;">TCP</br>Tranmission Control Protocol</br></br>IP</br>Internet Protocol</div>

<captioned-image img-file="img/apps-crumbs-protocols.svg" float="right" img-width="16"></captioned-image>

<captioned-image img-file="img/protocols.jpg" caption="http://gumuskaya.com/images/tcp-ip.jpg" img-width="12"></captioned-image>

???
The communication protocol is the basic building block for any network to come together on the digital side.

It is the language that the computers use to send data back and forth to each other.

Two open protocols, TCP and IP, are responsible for most of the data routing

and transmission across the internet, and many more protocols are built on top

of them to provide application-level functionality, such as email, file transfer,

audio streaming, and lots more.

## Client software

### Transfers data between the computer and the server

<captioned-image img-file="img/apps-crumbs-client.svg" float="right" img-width="16"></captioned-image>

<captioned-image img-file="img/mobile-app.png" caption="https://techniblogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Telegram-Secret-chat-1.png" img-width="10" ></captioned-image>

???
This is the software that runs on your computer

An installed application

An Internet browser

A website running on the browser

The app I install on my computer or smartphone, or a website I visit.

It provides a user interface to interact with an online service

---
## Server software

### Processes data

<captioned-image img-file="img/apps-crumbs-server.svg" float="right" img-width="16"></captioned-image>

<captioned-image img-file="img/server-sw.png" caption="By ZxxZxxZ - Own work, GPL, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=16485488" img-width="24" float="right"></captioned-image>

???
Server software processes website requests, user sessions, database queries, etc.

This is the software that would run on a Facebook datacenter computer.

The payload is extracted from the data packet at this point, and the databases

in facebook are updated with a record of you liking the post.

Facebook then sends a message back to your computer to say, yes, you have now liked this post.

Next time someone loads that post, they will be able to see you liked it.

### Foster competition

### Operate or manage ISPs

### Engage in mass surveillance

### Block Internet access

A government owned ISP does not necessarily solve the issues of ownerhsip

In some countries governments are able to shut down internet services, or monitor and control the apps and content available to citizens

So now that we have these wires in place and have the apps to

send data back and forth, who owns this data?

Is it facebook? Is it the internet service providers?

Unfortunately, depending on the terms of service we agree to when we sign up for a given service,

chances are whoever collects it.

How does this happen?

## Real-time bidding

<captioned-image img-file="img/real-time-bidding.jpg" img-width="24" float="off"></captioned-image>

???
Real-time bidding is a means by which advertising inventory is bought

and sold on a per-impression basis, via instantaneous

programmatic auction, similar to financial markets.

With real-time bidding, advertising buyers bid on an impression and,

if the bid is  won, the buyer's ad is instantly displayed

on the publisher's site.

Who is the product? YOU

## The Facebook content funnel

<captioned-image img-file="img/facebook-tunnel.png" caption="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-european-union-versus-the-internet/" img-width="55" float="off"></captioned-image>

???
This chart shows how the past decade saw the rise of facebook

as a referral source for news. This means that more people are reaching content through it.

A near duopoly between Facebook and Google for Online Advertising.

Online advertising is driving down other forms of advertising and ad revenues for independent publishing such as smalll local news publishers

---
## Referral source of traffic to top web publishers

<captioned-image img-file="img/content-gates.png" caption="https://blog.parse.ly/post/2855/facebook-continues-to-beat-google-in-sending-traffic-to-top-publishers/" img-width="32" float="off"></captioned-image>

???
Traditionally, search has led us to different websites.

Increasingly, facebook (and google) are becoming a “funnel”/”filter” for search results

and content in their ecosystem.

These companies engage in real-time bidding for advertisers to bid on impressions.

---
## Entrenched monopolies

<captioned-image img-file="img/web-monopolies.jpg" caption="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/internet-giants-owns-web/" img-width="24" float="off"></captioned-image>

???
Entrenched monopolies:

Use market dominance to quash competition

Google’s dominance in Search, Chrome, and Android create an anti-competitive landscape

Facebook linking user data across Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus

They are able to track user data across different services and devices

Thanks to large advertising revenue and acquisitions, they are able to fence off

the social media market and become the only player in this area.

???
User behaviour manipulation

These tech giants now dictate what you see and how you communicate online.

One consequence -both intended and unintended- of this system is the behaviour manipulation of users.

This may be due to users being targeted for maximum engagement -and thus monetization-

or for an explicit outcome (polarizing voters to sway election results).

We haven't even talked about data breaches and geoblocks.

???
Going back to the original question of who owns the internet.

While the Internet Service Providers may claim ownership to access to the internet at large,

it's mostly these internet giants that control the data and content availability to their users.

So, is there a way we opt out of this system and still be able to participate in the Internet?
