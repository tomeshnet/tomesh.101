# What is the "commons"?

## The resources and practices jointly held and shared by all members of a community.

## They are neither privately owned by individuals, or publicly owned by the state.

### also...

???

The land, water bodies, and the atmosphere we depend on for survival can be considered as "commons".

---

# What is the "commons"?

## The _social practice_ of governing a resource not by market or state, but by a **community of users** that self-governs the resource through institutions that it creates.

???
Define what we mean by the commons, and then go into a few examples

How does it address our pressing issues? (from last session)

Prompt: Can anyone think of collectively/community owned and maintained spaces?

# Sustainable commons

## Elinor Ostrom's 8 Design Principles

### 1. Clear boundaries of common resources and membership
### 2. Match rules governing use to local needs
### 3. Those affected by the rules participate in decisions
### 4. Effective system to monitor member behaviour

???
So, what happens if somebody eats all the food, or takes all the plants home?

In order to be sustainable, political economist Elinor Ostrom

identified eight "design principles" of stable commons management.

- Clear definition of the contents of the resource and who is included 

and excluded from participating

---

# Sustainable commons

## Elinor Ostrom's 8 Design Principles

### 5. Graduated sanctions when rules are violated
### 6. Mechanisms of conflict resolution
### 7. Self-determination respected by external authorities
### 8. Nested tiers of governing enterprises

???

A scale of graduated sanctions for members who violate the rules

Mechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap and of easy access

Multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small local 

institutions at the base level.

# What is the "digital commons"?


<captioned-image img-file="img/wikipedia.svg" float="right" img-width="20"></captioned-image>

## The distribution and communal ownership of technology infrastructure and informational resources.

Examples of the digital commons include wikis, open-source software, and open-source licensing.

The digital commons provides the community with free and easy access to information.

# Open vs. closed protocols

## `http://info.cern.ch`
#### — home of the first website

???
In the 1980s, there were a number of private services such as Prodigy and America Online

whose networking protocols (using standard telephone lines) were closed and proprietary.

Therefore the only services and innovation within those digital realms were seller-authorized

activities that were seen as contributing to the bottom line. When the open standards of

the World Wide Web arrived in the early 1990s and exploded with the release of the Netscape browser,

countless, unanticipated user-driven websites and projects blossomed -- a direct result of
 
an open, shareable protocol. In short order, the top-down, seller-controlled ecosystem

of private vendors was eclipsed by the more versatile, socially accessible commons-based

ecosystem of the Internet.

# Software: Linux

<captioned-image img-file="img/tux.svg" img-width="20"></captioned-image>

# Network Infrastructure as Commons

???
Play some videos for examples of community networks:

hearing the experience from someone who has experienced it

firsthand is very powerful

---

# What is a "community network"?

## A **community network** consists of communication infrastructure collectively owned and managed by the community, operating under the principles of democratic participation of their members.
