# Previously in _Who owns the Internet?_...

First, a recap of part one of the series.

We covered how the internet works, using the wires and apps divide.

???
The ISPs own the wires, tech giants own the apps.

Both own our data.

# The Commons

---

## What is the commons?

### The cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable earth.

### These resources are held in common, not owned privately.

### also...

---

## What is the commons?

### The _social practice_ of governing a resource not by state or market but by a **community** of users that self-governs the resource through institutions that it creates.

???
Define what we mean by the commons, and then go into a few examples

How does it address our pressing issues? (from last session)

Prompt: Can anyone think of collectively/community owned and maintained spaces?

# Digital commons

???
The digital commons are a form of commons involving the distribution 

and communal ownership of informational resources and technology.

Resources are typically designed to be used by the community by which they are created.

Examples of the digital commons include wikis, open-source software, and open-source licensing.

The digital commons provides the community with free and easy access to information.

## Digital commons

### Open vs closed protocols

## http://info.cern.ch: home of the first website

???
In the 1980s, there were a number of private services such as Prodigy and America Online

whose networking protocols (using standard telephone lines) were closed and proprietary.

Therefore the only services and innovation within those digital realms were seller-authorized

activities that were seen as contributing to the bottom line. When the open standards of

the World Wide Web arrived in the early 1990s and exploded with the release of the Netscape browser,

countless, unanticipated user-driven websites and projects blossomed -- a direct result of
 
an open, shareable protocol. In short order, the top-down, seller-controlled ecosystem

of private vendors was eclipsed by the more versatile, socially accessible commons-based

ecosystem of the Internet.

# Network infrastructure as commons

???
Play some videos for examples of community networks:

hearing the experience from someone who has experienced it

firsthand is very powerful

---

# What is a community network?

## **Community networks** consist of communication infrastructure collectively owned and managed by the community, operating under the principles of democratic participation of their members

#### - Adapted from Cumbre Latinoamericana de Redes Comunitarias, Argentina 2018
 

---

# Global community networks

### Some consequences:

## Local regenerative economies

## Local capacity to operate infrastructure

## Neighbours over big tech consumerism

???
Lead to a big prompt for the audience to share

(draw parallel with “buying local” vs. Amazon)

We can draw on analogies in local agriculture, etc. that are

more mainstream and well understood

Pros: Agency for digital privacy, political censorship, capacity to

support marginalized and underserved peers of our community

- Promote the practice rather than consumption of digital technology

---

# Community networks

### Some (more) consequences:

## More inclusive and affordable Internet access

## Prosumer class that can elevates tech literacy

## More resilient local networks

## Local peer-learning and professional development

???
Explain "prosumer"

Promote avenues to develop local content and services for better data residency and community resilience

Engage a variety of stakeholders toward collective ownership of communication infrastructure

## Our tech needs more humane relationships

### Bring "care" to our digital life

### There is no “market demand” for taking care of our most marginalized communities

### Community networks enable civil society to build equitable access for our neighbours

### Build strong human relationships through tech

## Experiment with software that respects users

### Scuttlebutt is a peer-to-peer social network that cannot track user behaviour

### There are many other free software that prioritize their users
